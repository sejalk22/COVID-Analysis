# U.S. States COVID Analysis
This project analyses COVID data, such as cases and deaths, from all U.S. States. There is a special focus on four states: Alabama, Michigan, Oregon, and Nebraska. The data spans from January 22, 2020 to November 7, 2022. 

# Files Description & Methodology 
There are two files: 

- The **Final Access File** is where the data was cleaned, joined, and analyzed in Microsoft Access using SQL. 

- The **Final Data Warehouse Excel** file stores the final data and was used to create dashboards and insights. I used this data to construct managerial recommendations overall and specifically for the selected four state governments.
